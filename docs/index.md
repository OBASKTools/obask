# Ontology Based Application Starter Kit (OBASK) Guide

Ontology Based Application Starter Kit (OBASK) is an innovative tool that empowers users to easily create search and knowledge exploration applications using their ontologies, without the need for any programming skills. With OBASK, users can quickly kickstart an ontology-driven application by simply defining their input ontologies and providing gross classifications via configuration files.

Once the configuration is set up, OBASK takes care of the heavy lifting, automatically generating knowledge search endpoints, Solr indexes, and materialized knowledge graphs with a single command. This means that users can focus on exploring and analyzing their data without getting bogged down in technical details.

With OBASK, users can harness the full potential of their ontologies to create powerful and insightful applications that enable them to better understand and analyze their data.
