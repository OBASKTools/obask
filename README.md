# obask

Congigurations for the Ontology Based Application Starter Kit

WARNING:  OBASK tools originated with work carried out to support the [Virtual Fly Brain](virtualflybrain.org) project, the [Allen Cell-Type Knowledge Explorer](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/celltypes) and the [Cell Annotation Platform](celltype.info).  Work to split this out into OBASK tools is currently ongoing and so code on this repo should be considered Alpha and may be subject to breaking changes.
